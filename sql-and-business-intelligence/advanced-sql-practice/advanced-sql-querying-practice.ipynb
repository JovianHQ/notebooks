    "4. Since you'll be using a temporary online service for code execution, save your work by pressing **cntrl+ s or cmd + s** at regular intervals.\n",

    "Relational databases generally have two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Server/Engine**: A software package that manages databases and runs in the background, listening for SQL queries from authorized users E.g. MySQL server, Microsoft SQL server, Postgres etc.\n",
    "2. **Database Client**: A command-line tool or graphical user interface (GUI) to connect to the database server and run SQL queries. E.g. MySQL workbench, PgAdmin etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server and client can be on the same computer e.g. both on your laptop, or on different computers e.g. the database server can be running on the cloud and you can connect to it using a client installed on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most database servers/engines are designed to operate on databases containing large amounts of data (e.g. 100s of GBs) and to handle a very high volume of queries (e.g. thousands of queries per second). They typically require powerful hardware i.e. multi-core CPUs and large amounts of RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.sqlite.org/images/sqlite370_banner.gif\" width=\"240\" style=\"margin-left:0\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, however, we'll use a lightweight database engine called [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), which is well-suited for databases with small amounts of data and has very limited CPU & RAM requirements. Despite being limited in its capabilities, it is the [most widely used database engine in the world](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html). SQLite is used by smartphone apps, web browsers, desktop applications, IoT devices etc. to store and manage data locally on the device. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running this assignment locally, you'll need to [download and install `sqlite3`](https://www.servermania.com/kb/articles/install-sqlite/) on your computer. `sqlite3` is already installed on Binder. You can verify that you have `sqlite3` installed by running the following command to show the version of SQLite you have installed:"
