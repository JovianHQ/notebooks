    "SQL is an essential language used for managing relational databases. We have curated 30 SQL practice questions of varying difficulty levels to help individuals improve their SQL coding skills. These questions are designed to test your knowledge of SQL syntax and help you practice writing effective SQL queries that retrieve, filter, and sort data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "By practicing these SQL practice questions, you can gain a better understanding of SQL syntax, build a strong foundation in SQL, and prepare for job interviews, coding challenges, or real-world projects that involve working with databases. With a range of questions designed to challenge individuals at every level, these SQL practice questions are an excellent way to improve your SQL skills and become a more proficient SQL coder."
