    "## Summary and Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the topics we've covered in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiplication Principle**:  If we have $k$ independent choices to make, and the number of options for each choice are $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_k$, then we can make all of the choices in $x_1 \\times x_2 \\times x_3 \\times \\ldots \\times x_k$ ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Repeated choice rule**: A special case of the multiplication principle is when the number of options is the same for each choice. If we have $k$ independent choices to make, and the number of options for each choice is $n$, then we can make all the choices in $n^k$ ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Factorial Rule**: The number of ways of arranging $n$ items in list is $n!$ i.e. $n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\ldots \\times 2 \\times 1 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Permutation rule**: The number of ways of arranging $k$ items in a list out of $n$ items is $n!/(n-k)!$. This number is also denoted as ${}^nP_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$${}^nP_k = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = n \\times (n-1) \\times \\ldots \\times (n-k+1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combination Rule**: The number of ways of choosing $k$ items out of $n$ items is $\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$. It is denoted by ${}^nC_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$${}^nC_k = \\frac{{}^nP_k}{k!} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} = \\frac{n \\times (n-1) \\times \\ldots \\times (n-k+1)}{k \\times (k-1) \\times \\ldots \\times 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Probability**: The rules of counting can be applied to compute probabilities events involving repeated experiments (or multiple different kinds of experiments).\n",
