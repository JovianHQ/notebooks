    "Product analytics is a subdomain of data science concerned with understanding how users interact with digital products. We use several digital products everyday (websites, mobile applications, wearables, smart speakers etc.). Many of these products are used by millions of people, sometimes even billions. Understanding user behavior is key to improving digital products. \n",

    "There are two ways to understand user behavior: qualitative (talking to individual users) and quantitative (collecting data from users' actions). Due to the sheer volume of users, qualitative studies are often too expensive or inefficient.

    "## User Journeys for Digital Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can analyze user behavior, it's important to first understand how users interact with a digital product over time. As an example, let's consider Nike's online store: https://www.nike.com/ . E-commerce accounts for over 30% of Nike's global sales, so improving the customer experience on the online store is just as important as improving the customer experience in a physical store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey of a typical user (let's call him Jim) may look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jim sees an advertisement for Nike shoes on their Facebook feed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LSqYMMm.png\" width=\"400\">\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mBzl61x.png\" width=\"360\">\n",

    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mA8Vu9p.png\" width=\"400\">\n",

    "## The Pirate Funnel (AAARRR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pirate funnel (so-called because of the acronym AAARRR) is a commonly-used framework for tracking the product usage lifecycle of users and identifying areas for improvement. The funnel has the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Awareness**: A user learns about the product\n",
    "2. **Acquisition**: The user tries out the product\n",
    "3. **Activation**: The users takes the first important step\n",
    "4. **Revenue**: The user makes a payment (becomes a customer)\n",
    "5. **Retention**: The user makes repeated payments\n",
    "6. **Referral**: The user brings other users to the product\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that not all of these stages apply to every product and some stages may involve multiple steps. The framework is called a \"funnel\" because there's a possibility of users dropping off at each stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the graph showing the number of users who have completed each stage might look like([source](https://growwithward.com/aaarrr-pirate-funnel/)): \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lD0oy9Y.png\" width=\"480\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the user experience, it's important to measure the conversion from each step to the next, and identify the biggest bottlenecks:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://gustdebacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bottleneck-research.png\" width=\"460\">\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Referral refers to act of a user recommending a product to others (friends, colleagues, family, etc). Referrals are a strong sign that users find a product valuable, and it may even become the primary acquisition channel for a product.  It is not always possible to measure referrals accurately. However, many products contain built-in ways to refer other users to a platform, and some even incentivize referrals by offering exclusive discounts to the referrer and the referee. Here's an example:\n",

    "- No. of users who send invites\n",
    "- No. of invites sent per user\n",
    "- Percentage conversion of invites\n",
    "- K factor: The average number of new users that an existing user invites to the platform.\n",
