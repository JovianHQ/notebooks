    "As you go through this notebook, you will find the symbol **???** in certain places. To complete this assignment, you must replace all the **???** with appropriate values, expressions, or statements to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to run all the code cells in order. Otherwise, you may get errors like `NameError` for undefined variables.\n",
    "2. Do not change variable names, delete cells, or disturb other existing code. It may cause problems during evaluation.\n",
    "3. In some cases, you may need to add some code cells or new statements before or after the line of code containing the **???**. \n",
    "4. Since you'll be using a temporary online service for code execution, save your work by running `jovian.commit` at regular intervals.\n",
    "5. Questions marked **(Optional)** will not be considered for evaluation and can be skipped. They are for your learning.\n",
    "6. If you are stuck, you can ask for help on the bootcamp Slack group. Post errors, ask for hints, and help others, but **please don't share the complete solution code on Slack** to give others a chance to write the code themselves.\n",
    "7. There are some tests included with this notebook to help you test your implementation. However, after submission, your code will be tested with some hidden test cases. Make sure to test your code exhaustively to cover all edge cases.\n"

    "### How to Run the Code and Save Your Work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)**: Click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Running on your computer locally**: To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org) & [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/), download the notebook and install the required libraries. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Saving your work**: You can save a snapshot of the assignment to your [Jovian](https://jovian.ai) profile, so that you can access it later and continue your work. Keep saving your work by running `jovian.commit` from time to time."
