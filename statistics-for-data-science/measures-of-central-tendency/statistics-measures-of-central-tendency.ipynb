E.g. the median of the numbers $3, 7, 10, 55, 97$ is $10$. \n\n\n* When the size of the set is even, there's no single middle number. In this case, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. E.g. the median of $3, 5, 21, 33, 42, 300$ is $(21 + 33)/2 = 27$.\n\n\n* A percentile is the generalization of median. The K-th percentile is a number equal to or larger than K % of the values in the set. The median is the 50-th percentile.\n\n\n### Quartiles and Range\n\n* Quartile are numbers that divide a dataset into 4 equal parts (or quarters). A dataset has three quartiles:\n\n  1. **1st Quartile or Q1**: 25% of values lie below it i.e. it's the 25th percentile\n  2. **2nd Quartile or Q2**: 50% of values lie below it i.e. it's the median or 50th percentile\n  3. **3rd Quartile or Q3**: 75% of values lie below it i.e. it's the 75th percentile\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SQXnns4.png\" width=\"360\">\n\n* Range of a set of numbers is defined by two values: the minimum and the maximum. Ranges and quartiles are often used together to get a sense of the spread and distribution of values in a dataset.\n\n* The range and quartiles of a set of numbers are often plotted using a \"box-and-whiskers\" plot (sometimes just called a box plot).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vB42RrG.png)\n\n\n### Mode and Frequency Tables\n\n* The mode of a set of values is simply the most frequently occurring value in the set. E.g. the mode of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8]` is `4` because it occurs more times than any other value.\n\n\n* If there isn't a single value that occurs most frequently, all the values are occur most frequently are modes. The data is said to be *multimodal* in such cases. E.g. The set `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 4]` has two modes, `1` and `4`, which both occur twice.\n\n\n* Unlike mean and median, mode is not limited to numbers, it is defined for any set of values. The mode of the set of values `['red', 'green', 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'green', 'green']` is `'green'`.\n\n\n* A frequency table shows how many times each observation occurs in a dataset.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MeRJqAg.png\" width=\"240\">\n\n\n### Skewness of Data\n\n* Skewness, in statistics, is the degree of asymmetry observed in a set of observations. \n\n* The relative order of mean, median and mode indicates the direction of skewness in the dataset.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/0*wHMvuwRa_YF9SFwY.png)\n\n\n### Variance and Standard Deviation\n\n* The **variance** of a set of numbers measures how far each number is from the mean of the set. It is denoted by the symbol $\\sigma^2$ (pronounced \"sigma squared\") and is defined by the formula:\n\n  $$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{ (x_1 - \\mu)^2 + (x_2 - \\mu)^2 + ... + (x_n - \\mu)^2 }{n}$$\n\n  $$\\textrm{Variance} = \\frac{\\textrm{Sum of squares of difference between observations and mean}} {\\textrm{Number of observations}}$$\n\n\n* The **standard deviation** of a set of numbers is defined as the square root of the variance. It is denoted by the symbol $\\sigma$ (pronounced \"sigma\") and is defined by the formula\n\n  $$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{ (x_1 - \\mu)^2 + (x_2 - \\mu)^2 + ... + (x_n - \\mu)^2 }{n}}$$\n\n  $$\\textrm{ Standard Deviation } = \\sqrt{\\textrm{ Variance }}$$\n\n\n### Growth and Average Growth Rate\n\n* Growth in any period is defined the percentage increase in the number since the previous period:\n\n$$\\textrm{Growth} =  \\frac{\\textrm{Current Value} - \\textrm{Previous Value}} {\\textrm{Previous Value}}$$\n\n* The Average Growth Rate is the percentage of growth, when applied across all periods, results in the same final number. It is given by the formula:\n\n$$ \\textrm{Average Growth} = r = \\sqrt[n]{(1+r_1)(1+r_2)...(1+r_n)} - 1$$\n\n* Projecting growth forward can help us estimate numbers in the future. If the average growth rate is $r$ and the number is $N$, the number $k$ periods later is given by:\n\n$$N_k = N(1+r)^k$$\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"697b32cf","metadata":{},"source":["## Review Questions and Further Reading\n","\n","Based on what you've learned in this tutorial, try to come up with general strategies to answer the following questions:\n","\n","- How much will you earn after graduating from university?\n","- How hot is it going to be in the summer this year?\n","- Should your investment portfolio be focused on diversified?\n","- Which movie should you watch this weekend?\n","- How many registered users will your website have one year from now?\n","\n","\n","Here are some resources for learning more:\n","\n","\n","* https://www.math-only-math.com/worksheet-on-mean-median-and-mode.html\n","* https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability\n","* https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/numpy/python-numpy-stat.php\n","* https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":91,"id":"fddbc75b","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/javascript":["window.require && require([\"base/js/namespace\"],function(Jupyter){Jupyter.notebook.save_checkpoint()})"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[jovian] Attempting to save notebook..\u001b[0m\n","[jovian] Updating notebook \"aakashns/statistics-measures-of-central-tendency\" on https://jovian.ai/\u001b[0m\n","[jovian] Uploading notebook..\u001b[0m\n","[jovian] Capturing environment..\u001b[0m\n","[jovian] Committed successfully! https://jovian.ai/aakashns/statistics-measures-of-central-tendency\u001b[0m\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["'https://jovian.ai/aakashns/statistics-measures-of-central-tendency'"]},"execution_count":91,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["jovian.commit()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b562d155","metadata":{},"source":["## Questions for revision\n","1.\tWhat are the measures of central tendency?\n","2.\tWhy do we use mean, median and mode?\n","3.\tHow can we calculate mean, median and mode in python?\n","4.\tWhat package do we require to calculate the measures of central tendency in python?\n","5.\tWhat is the purpose of weighted averages?
