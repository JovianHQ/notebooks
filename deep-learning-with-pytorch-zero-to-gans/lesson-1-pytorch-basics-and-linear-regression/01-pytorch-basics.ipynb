    "This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai) (don't worry if these terms seem unfamiliar; we'll learn more about them soon). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",

    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Colab**. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

    "## Summary and Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introductions to PyTorch tensors\n",
    "* Tensor operations and gradients\n",
    "* Interoperability between PyTorch and Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors in PyTorch support various operations, and what we've covered here is by no means exhaustive. You can learn more about tensors and tensor operations here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested, you can learn more about matrix derivatives on Wikipedia (although it's not necessary for following along with this series of tutorials): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus#Derivatives_with_matrices .\n",
    "\n",
    "The material in this series is inspired by [PyTorch Tutorial for Deep Learning Researchers](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial) by Yunjey Choi and [FastAI development notebooks](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs/tree/master/dev_nb) by Jeremy Howard. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we complete our discussion of tensors and gradients in PyTorch, and we're ready to move on to the next topic: [Gradient Descent & Linear Regression](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/02-linear-regression)."
