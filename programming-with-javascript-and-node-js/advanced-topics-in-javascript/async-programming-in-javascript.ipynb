    "Asynchronous programming is a vital concept in modern web development, especially in JavaScript. It enables developers to create efficient and responsive applications that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Unlike synchronous programming, where the code runs sequentially, asynchronous programming allows a program to execute tasks in the background while other operations continue to run. This approach significantly improves the user experience by preventing the program from freezing or becoming unresponsive. \n",

    "### Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the first function completes its task. Callbacks are an essential aspect of asynchronous programming because they enable developers to write code that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, without blocking the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how callbacks work in JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function fetchData(url, successCallback, errorCallback) {\n",
    "  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n",
    "  xhr.open(\"GET\", url);\n",
    "  xhr.onload = function() {\n",
    "    if (xhr.status === 200) {\n",
    "      successCallback(xhr.response);\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "      errorCallback(xhr.status);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  };\n",
    "  xhr.onerror = function() {\n",
    "    errorCallback(xhr.status);\n",
    "  };\n",
    "  xhr.send();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fetchData(\n",
    "  \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\",\n",
    "  function(response) {\n",
    "    console.log(JSON.parse(response));\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  function(error) {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n",
    "  }\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we define a function `fetchData` that takes three parameters: the URL of the API endpoint, a success callback function, and an error callback function. We use the `XMLHttpRequest` object to make a GET request to the specified URL. When the request completes, the `onload` event is fired, and we check the `status` property of the `XMLHttpRequest` object to determine whether the request was successful or not. If it was successful, we call the success callback function and pass it the response as an argument. If there was an error, we call the error callback function and pass it the HTTP status code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then call the `fetchData` function with the URL of the API endpoint and two callback functions: one to handle the successful response and one to handle errors. In the success callback function, we parse the JSON response and log it to the console. In the error callback function, we log an error message to the console."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "Promises are another way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and they provide a cleaner and more organized way of dealing with callbacks. A promise represents a future value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved eventually. The value may be resolved or rejected, and the promise can be in one of three states: pending, resolved, or rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promises have three methods: `then()`, `catch()`, and `finally()`. The `then()` method is called when the promise is resolved, and it takes a success callback function as an argument. The `catch()` method is called when the promise is rejected, and it takes an error callback function as an argument. The `finally()` method is called regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected, and it takes a callback function as an argument."

    "    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n",
    "    xhr.open(\"GET\", url);\n",
    "    xhr.onload = function() {\n",
    "      if (xhr.status === 200) {\n",
    "        resolve(xhr.response);\n",
    "      } else {\n",
    "        reject(xhr.status);\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    xhr.onerror = function() {\n",
    "      reject(xhr.status);\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    xhr.send();\n",
    "  });\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fetchData(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\")\n",
    "  .then(function(response) {\n",
    "    console.log(JSON.parse(response));\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .catch(function(error) {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this modified example, we define the `fetchData` function to return a promise. We create a new promise object and use the `resolve` and `reject` functions to handle the completion of the asynchronous operation. In the `then` method, we parse the JSON response and log it to the console, and in the `catch` method, we log an error message to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the `fetchData` function with the URL of the API endpoint, and then we chain a `then` method to handle the successful response and a `catch` method to handle errors. This code is equivalent to the previous example that used callbacks, but it is more concise and easier to read."

    "### Async/Await\n",
    "\n",
    "Async/await is a newer approach to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It was introduced in ECMAScript 2017 and is built on top of promises. Async/await allows us to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, which makes it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using async/await to fetch data from an API endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "async function fetchData(url) {\n",
    "  const response = await fetch(url);\n",
    "  if (response.ok) {\n",
    "    const data = await response.json();\n",
    "    return data;\n",
    "  } else {\n",
    "    throw new Error(`Error fetching data: ${response.status}`);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "(async function() {\n",
    "  try {\n",
    "    const data = await fetchData(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\");\n",
    "    console.log(data);\n",
    "  } catch (error) {\n",
    "    console.error(error);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "})();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define an `async` function `fetchData` that uses the `await` keyword to wait for the response of the `fetch` method. If the response is successful, we use the `await` keyword again to parse the JSON data and return it. If the response is not successful, we throw an error with a message indicating the HTTP status code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define an immediately invoked async function expression (IIFE) to call the `fetchData` function and handle errors using a `try`/`catch` block. We use the await keyword to wait for the result of the `fetchData` function, and then we log the data to the console. If an error occurs, we log the error message to the console."
