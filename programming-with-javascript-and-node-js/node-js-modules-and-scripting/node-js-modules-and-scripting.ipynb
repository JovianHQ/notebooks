    "Here's what's going on in the code:\n",
    "1. The code imports the `fs` and `path` modules, as well as a custom `commerce` module that contains a `calculateTotalPrice()` function.\n",
    "2. The code reads in command-line arguments using the `process.argv` array, which should contain a file name and a discount percentage.\n",
    "3. The code constructs the file paths for the input and output files using the `path.join()` method to combine the file name with the \"input\" and \"output\" directories.\n",
    "4. The code logs a message indicating which input file is being processed.\n",
    "5. The code checks if the input file exists using the `fs.existsSync()` method.\n",
    "6. If the input file exists, the code reads in the file using the `fs.readFileSync()` method, parses it as JSON using `JSON.parse()`, and passes the resulting object to the `calculateTotalPrice()` function along with the discount percentage.\n",
    "6. The `calculateTotalPrice()` function computes the total price of the items in the cart, along with any applicable discount amount and discounted price.\n",
    "7. The code writes the result of the calculation to an output file using the `fs.writeFileSync()` method and logs a message indicating where the output file was written.\n",
    "8. If the input file does not exist, the code logs an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the code reads in a JSON file containing purchase data, calculates the total price along with any applicable discounts, and writes the result to a new JSON file. If the input file does not exist, the code logs an error message.\n",
