So data is stored somewhere like a database where administrators can directly make changes, then information is fetched from their to display on the website. \n","We will not connect to a database today but stimulate the process. \n","\n","\n","- We will create a dictionary of jobs that we want to pass into our website. \n","\n","  <p float='left'>\n","<img src='https://i.imgur.com/fMxjwEP.png' width='500'></p>\n","\n","- Then we will add an argument in the `render_template` as `jobs` and then we can head to html to add add this with the help of a special template called **Jinja Template**. \n","\n","```\n","def hello_jovian():\n","  return render_template('home.html', jobs=JOBS)\n","```\n","\n","\n","#### Jinja Template \n","\n","It is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code. \n","\n","We can use jinja template to customize html tags. That is exactly what we are going to do here. \n","Here's a cheatsheet on using Jinja Template to add fields into your flask app: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-flask/modules/flask-templates-and-forms/cheatsheet\n","\n","- We will head over to `home.html`, to where we want to insert these jobs and add: `{{jobs}}`. You'll notice that whatever information we put inside our `jobs` dictionary will appear as a string:\n","\n","  ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/izM10Z4.png)\n","\n","We can also use this to pass other variables like `company_name = 'Jovian'` and use jinja template to render the company name wherever within the `home.html`. \n","\n","\n","#### For Loop Inside Template\n","\n","These templates support a special syntax to select particular information from python datastructure. \n","\n","We can access the elements within a dictionary just how we would in python. So let's get the `title` from the `jobs` dictionary.  \n","\n","Syntax:\n","```\n","{% for job in jobs %}\n","  <div>{{job['title']}}</div>\n","{% endfor %}\n","```\n","This is what the above piece of code will result to: \n","<p float='left'>\n","<img src='https://i.imgur.com/7DxKLkz.png' width='500'></p>\n","\n","To make it appear like we want, we can add html accordingly. \n","\n","This is what our final code and output looks like with jinja template:\n","\n","<p float='left'>\n","<img src='https://i.imgur.com/21Novy8.png' width='800'></p>\n","\n","Another thing we can do here is, to add all the jinja template code to another file called `jobitem.html`, and add `{% include 'jobitem.html' %}` instead,  which should look something like this: \n","\n","![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bFe6jgU.png)\n","\n","\n","This is how we can structure our templates and extract reusable components from our code. \n","\n","Again, we can use BootStrap to add the Apply button and make our website look presentable. We can directly google or search in the bootstrap documentation for any functionality we want to add. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Adding API Route to Return JSON \n","\n","\n","\n","Another way to represent dynamic data is using API - Application Programming Interface. For this, instead of rendering a tempplate, we can simply call a JSON file. JSON is simply **JavaScript Objects**.  \n","\n","For returning a JSON string, we will use the function `jsonify`, and instead of routing `('/')`, we will route `('/jobs')` and return our json string. We can do this with the help of a function. \n","\n","<img src='https://i.imgur.com/9hJM2fN.png' width='350'>\n","\n","Now we have added another URL to our website, so if we go ahead and add extend /jobs on our home url we will be able to see: \n","\n","<img src='https://i.imgur.com/TFHPcCh.png' width='400'>\n","\n","This is exactly what Rest API or JSON API stand for. i.e our webpage is not just returning html but the same information is accesible with JSON. \n","\n","\n","We generally use the route: <img src='https://i.imgur.com/ZW7EqiT.png' width='200'> to differentiate this from html pages. "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Deploying Project \n","\n","To put your website into production you need to figure out some cloud platform to deploy your website. We will be using https://render.com/ for deploying our websites. There are more platforms like AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud etc... but Render is very easy to work with. \n","\n","The first step is to head to the **Version Control** tab in the left sidebar to commit your work to GitHub. Like we saw earlier, we will simply write down the changes we made, and press Commit&Push.\n","  \n","<img src='https://i.imgur.com/c2zzVy0.png' width='300'>\n","\n","\n","**Note:** \n","For those who weren't able to integrate and work with Flask earlier, now is the time to connect to github and integrate your changes. \n","\n","- We can head to https://render.com/ and create an account. Render provides a free plan to get started. \n","\n","- Once you have created an account you will be able to access a dashboard. Go ahead and press New+>WebService:\n","  <img src='https://i.imgur.com/p3MjzHM.png' width ='500'>\n","\n","- Again, we need to connect to github. We need to allow render to pull our code fom github by clicking on 'Connect Account'. \n","  <img src='https://i.imgur.com/rRayuos.png' width ='500'> \n","\n","- We will click on 'Connect' and now, we have to configure our code which is present on GitHub. For this, we need to provide the following details: \n","\n","**Name:** You can name it anything, its for internal reference.\n","\n","**Enviroment:** python3\n","\n","**Region:** It reflects where in the world the server is going to be. You might want to choose a place with less earthquakesüòÜ. \n","\n","**Built Command:** The build command is an important piece of code/command that needs to run to keep track of the libraries that need to be installed to run your project. For this we create a `requirement.txt` file and add `Flask` to it.\n","\n","  <img src='https://i.imgur.com/yhrJ9mr.png' width='500'>\n","\n","  This is an accepted standard in the python ecosystem wherein we put our requirements in a `requirement.txt` file for our python project to run. \n","\n","  Another library we will add to our `requirement.txt` file is `gunicorn`. `gunicorn` is a helper library for Flask for production with python, you can look up for it. And then we can commint the changes. \n","\n","  So for our **build command** we can write: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n","\n","\n","**Start Command:** For starting the server we will call `gunicorn`, the name of the file we want to be executed i.e `app:`, and then the name of the Flask app <img src='https://i.imgur.com/MQbRBZC.png' width='180'>which in our case is `app` itself. \n","\n","\n","<img src='https://i.imgur.com/LNkbigl.png'>\n","\n","This deployment process differs for each site.
