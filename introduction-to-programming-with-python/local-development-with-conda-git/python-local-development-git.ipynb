    "\n",
    "Create a new project on GitHub, then run the following commands on terminal inside your project folder:\n",

    "$ git init\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working on a Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common workflow: you'll use it several times a day. Every time you've made some significant changes to your project, run the following commands on terminal inside your project folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git diff\n",
    "$ git add .\n",
    "$ git commit -m \"a description of the change\"\n",

    "\n",
    "If you've done something wrong and want to revert completely to a previous commit, run:\n",

    "$ git log\n",
    "$ git checkout commit_hash\n",
    "$ git reset --hard HEAD\n",

    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that you needn't remember all (or any) Git commands. You can figure out what you need when you need it by checking this notebook, searching online (Google / StackOverflow) and looking up documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above workflows work fine for personal projects, the workflows for collaborative projects are a bit different, and require some more Git commands.
