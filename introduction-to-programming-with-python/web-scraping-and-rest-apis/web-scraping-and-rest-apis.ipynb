It's a useful technique for creating datasets for research and learning. While web scraping often involves parsing and processing [HTML documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), some platforms offer REST APIs to retrieve information in a machine-readable format like JSON. In this tutorial, we'll use web scraping and REST APIs to create a real-world dataset.\n"
